# 🍩 ASCII Donut

Behold... the most useless yet most glorious piece of code ever written:  
A **rotating ASCII donut** in your terminal.  
Because 3D graphics cards are overrated and donuts are eternal.

## 🤯 What is this?

It’s a donut.  
It spins.  
It does math it has no business doing.  
It makes your terminal look cooler than your GPU could ever hope to.
